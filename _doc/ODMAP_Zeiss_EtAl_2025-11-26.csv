Overview,Hypotheses,Hypotheses,"Soil organisms are shown to be driven by climatic, topographic, habitat and edaphic factors. The main drivers of their distributions are (1) soil moisture, which is related to the availability of water through precipitation and can also be expressed as aridity (proportion of precipitation to evapotranspiration), (2) chemical and physical soil properties, such as pH, cation and heavy metal concentrations as well as soil texture, but also (3) the amount of organic carbon in soil that serves as resource for earthworms. In addition, (4) topographic factors were shown to drive large-scale distribution of many organisms including soil-related ones.

We included the following variables to represent climatic factors: Aridity Index, Mean annual precipitation (MAP), Mean annual temperature (MAT), and Snow cover (i.e., number of days with snow cover).  As habitat factors, we decided on the proportion of area covered by different land-use types, namely Agriculture, coniferous and deciduous Forest, Pastures, and Shrubland. In addition, we included Distance to urban areas, NDVI, and Population Density in our models. To account for topographic factors, we included Aspect (i.e., direction of a slope), Elevation, Slope, Distance to coast, and Distance to rivers. Finally, edaphic factors are depicted by Cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil texture expressed as Clay+Silt content, concentration of Copper (Cu), Mercury (Hg), Nitrogen (N), and Phosphorus (P),  as well as soil moisture, pH in H20, and content of Soil organic carbon (SOC)."

Overview,Algorithms,Model complexity,
Overview,Algorithms,Model averaging,"For species with at least 100 records (i.e., present in at least 100 4 km² grid cells), we performed BIOMOD ensemble modeling using all 12 available algorithms to estimate weighted average probability of presence (TSS as evaluation criteria; Thuiller et al., 2003; 2009). The 12 available algorithms are ANN, CTA, FDA; GAM, GLM, MARS, MAXENT, MAXNET, SRE, RF, RFd, and XGBoost. For species with at least 10 records but less than 100 records, we performed Ensembles of Small Models (ESM; Breiner et al., 2015; 2018) using two complementary algorithms, namely GLM, and MaxEnt and estimated weighted average probability of presence (TSS as evaluation criteria)."
Overview,Workflow,Model workflow,"Prior to model building, we standardized all predictor variables and used variance inflation (VIF) analysis to avoid highly correlated variables. We only considered variables with VIF<10. To avoid overfitting, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of predictor variables while maintaining the environmental heterogeneity. We included all axes that are needed to receive 80% of explained variance, that is the first 11 axes. Model fitting was done automatically as much as possible. In addition, we generated 1,000 individual background data for the models to increase their performances (i.e., randomly sampled pseudo-absences). Predictive model performance was assessed using TSS,  AUC(ROC), and Kappa."

Four climatic variables: aridity index, mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), and snow cover (i.e., number of days with snow cover). Eight habitat factors: five land-use types (agriculture, coniferous and deciduous forest, pastures, and shrubland), NDVI, distance to urban areas, and population density in our models. Five topographic variables: elevation, aspect (i.e., direction of a slope), slope, as well as distance to coast, and distance to rivers.
